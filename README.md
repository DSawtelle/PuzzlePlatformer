# PuzzlePlatformer
*Where is Mrs. Gumball?* is an animated puzzle platformer that uses randomized map generation and text file maps to generate a world for the users to explore as Mr. Gumball in search for his missing love, Mrs. Gumball.

## Gameplay
You can pick up coins to refill your life - but use them wisely, after 3 hits you die and there are only so many coins to go around! Don't forget that you can save the game and pick up where you left off later, too.
